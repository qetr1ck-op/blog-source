Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a `secure version` of the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTPS allows secure e-commerce transactions, such as on-line banking.

When a user connects to a website via HTTPS, the website encrypts the session with a Digital Certificate called as a `Secure Sockets Layer` (SSL), sometimes called Transport Layer Security (TLS) to send the information back.

Secure Sockets Layer uses a cryptographic system that encrypts data with two keys.

Web browsers show a padlock icon to indicate that the website is secure, as it also displays `https://` in the address bar. When a SSL Digital Certificate is installed on a web site, users can see a padlock icon at the bottom area of the navigator. When an Extended Validation Certificates is installed on a web site, users with the latest versions of browser will see the green address bar at the URL area of the navigator.
